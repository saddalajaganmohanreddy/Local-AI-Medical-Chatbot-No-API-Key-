### **Steps to Run Your Chatbot Again**

1. **Open VS Code** and navigate to your project folder:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\jagan\Desktop\medicalchat
```

2. **Activate your virtual environment**:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

> If you see `(venv)` at the start of the line, itâ€™s active.

3. **Run your chatbot script** (for testing in Python REPL):

```powershell
python
```

Then in Python:

```python
from chatbot import medical_chatbot

query = "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"
answer = medical_chatbot(query)
print("ðŸ’¡ Answer:", answer)
```

4. **Or run your Streamlit interface** (for web-based interaction):

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

* A browser window will open with your chatbot interface.
* Enter any medical question to get answers.

### **Notes for Future Use**

* Your **FAISS index is already saved**, so you donâ€™t need to reprocess the PDF.
* If you add new PDFs, youâ€™ll need to **run `ingest.py` again** to update the index.
* Always **activate your virtual environment** before running any scripts, so all libraries work correctly.
